# Ngrok Larry Example
Written by Josh Nixon

### Summary

I threw this demo together to show an example of using ngrok to quickly concept test using webhooks. This is meant for instructional purposes to be used in combination with a live presentation.

I built a simple Sinatra structure, there are many comments. Please feel free to use my code as reference to build your own Sinatra framework. I find that building my own skeleton framework every once and a while gets me back to some basics and uncovers potential on my rails projects as well as structure and meta-programming for simple ruby scripts.

To paraphrase Mark Twain, “I apologize for the [sloppiness] of this [code]. If I’d had more time it would have been [better].”
